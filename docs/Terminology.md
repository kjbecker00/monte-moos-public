# Terminology:  

## Definitions:
- **client**:  a computer that runs jobs from the host job queue  
- **host**:  oceanai (maintains host_job_queue, job_dirs/*, repo_links, and the results)  
- **job**:  a job is simply one way to run a mission  
    - A job can run multiple MOOSDBs that each source a different moos-ivp-extend repo  
    - This enables head-to-head missions where two repos have the same app names  
    - **job file**: a shell script containing all information on how to run a job  
- **post-processing script**:  a client-side script used to parse the `.alog+` files and generate metrics that may be used to score the files
    - these are run on the client after each job completes. If this script is changed, you will need to keep a backup of the `.alog+` files and re-run the script on all of them, so it is a good idea to make this as general as possible.
    - if you write the results to a single line in a csv, it will be merged with other results from the same job to form a compiled results csv
    - check out [docs/example_files/example_repo_links.txt/](example_files/example_repo_links.txt/)
- **repo links**:  a file containing links to every single repo used by the jobs in the job queue  
    - check out [docs/example_files/example_repo_links.txt/](example_files/example_repo_links.txt/)  

## Other terms:
- **job dir**:  a directory path with one or more jobs and a post-processing script  
    - check out [docs/example_files/example_job_dir/](example_files/example_job_dir/)  
- **moos dir**:  all known moos-ivp-extend repos (also inculdes moos-ivp)
    - a known moos-ivp-extend repo is a repo that can be pulled using `repo_links.txt`
- **job queue**:  a file containing an ordered list of jobs to be run  
    - check out [docs/example_files/example_host_job_queue.txt/](example_files/example_host_job_queue.txt/)  
- **result**:  a general term for the output from running a job one time
- **post-processing**:  taking the `.alog+` files and generating metrics that may be used to score the files  
- **compiling**:  taking post-processed results and combining them
    - Right now, it only does two things (to be expanded in the future)
        1. Merges each run's results.csv file 
        2. Generartes a scatterplot of column 1 (x axis) vs column 2 (y axis)



## Footnotes:
`.alog+` is shorthand for all alogs and other result files generated by running a job once
